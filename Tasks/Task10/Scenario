Write a script in PowerShell or Bash that checks your pod is running in your MiniKube environment and prints out the Pod Name and Namespace.


#!/bin/bash
#User has to give the pod name as input
echo "Enter name of pods you want to check"

#Pod name to be stores in variable "name"
read name

#command to the status of pods
kubectl  describe pods $name  | grep ^Status: | head -1 | awk '{print $1}{print $2}' | tr -d '\n'
echo "  :--bashing into minikube is done "

#storing pods status in "status" variable
status=`kubectl  describe pods $name  | grep ^Status: | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n'`

#storing name of pods in "Name" variable
Name=`kubectl  describe pods $name  | grep ^Name: | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n'`

#storing namespace in which pod is running in "Namespace" variable
Namespace=`kubectl  describe pods $name  | grep ^Namespace: | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n'`

if [ $status == "Running" ]
then
    printf "Name:$Name \nNamespace:$Namespace\n"
else
    echo "waiting for pods to be ready\n"
fi
